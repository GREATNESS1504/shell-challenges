# shell-challenges

I find ad-hoc shell pipelines to be a fun and efficient way to explore and manipulate data. However, they're not particularly easy to get started with. If you don't already feel comfortable with this hammer, you won't notice when you could solve a problem with it.

In this series, I hope to introduce shell commands so you can start seeing when you might apply them.
